# This node is run before the rest of the interface is configured.
# We first check to see if DHCPv6 is still configured on the interface by
# looking over at the interface address parameters.  Then we check to see
# if the DHCPv6 client program is still running on this interface.  If both
# of those are true, then any change to this tree means that the user
# has changed this tree ONLY, and that we are going to have to re-start
# the DHCPv6 client using the new parameters.
